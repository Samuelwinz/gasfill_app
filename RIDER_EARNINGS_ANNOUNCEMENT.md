## 💡 How It Works

### Delivery Tracking
The system counts `delivery_commission` entries from your earnings breakdown:
- Filters by date to calculate today's count
- Filters by last 7 days for weekly count
- Updates in real-time as you complete deliveries

### Bonus Progress
Automatically calculates your progress toward bonuses:
- **Daily**: 5 deliveries = ₵50.00 bonus
- **Weekly**: 25 deliveries = ₵200.00 bonus
- Progress bars change color when you reach 100%
- Shows celebration message: "🎉 Bonus unlocked!"

### Performance Metrics
- **Total Deliveries**: Lifetime count from all earnings
- **Average per Delivery**: Total earnings ÷ delivery count
- **Success Rate**: Currently 100% for all completed deliveries
