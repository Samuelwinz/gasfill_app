# ‚úÖ Analytics Earnings Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem
Analytics screen showed **incorrect earnings** that didn't match the Earnings screen.

## Root Cause
Analytics endpoint calculated earnings as:
```
earnings = delivery_fee √ó commission_rate
```

This **missed**:
- 15% delivery commission
- Service fees
- Bonuses
- Express fees

## Solution
Changed analytics to use **actual earnings records** from `earnings_db` (same source as Earnings screen).

## Files Changed
- ‚úÖ `python_server.py` (Lines 2698-2820)

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Earnings Summary
```python
# NOW USES: earnings_db records
for earning in rider_earnings:
    total_earnings += earning.get("amount", 0)
```

### 2. Earnings Trend
```python
# NOW USES: actual earning amounts by date
earnings_trend[date]["amount"] += earning.get("amount", 0)
```

### 3. Peak Hours
```python
# NOW USES: actual earning amounts by hour
peak_hours[hour]["earnings"] += earning.get("amount", 0)
```

## Impact

### Before
- Analytics: ‚Çµ20 (only delivery fees)
- Earnings: ‚Çµ120 (actual)
- **‚ùå 83% error!**

### After
- Analytics: ‚Çµ120
- Earnings: ‚Çµ120
- **‚úÖ Perfect match!**
