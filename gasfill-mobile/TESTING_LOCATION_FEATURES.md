## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Find on Map" Button Not Working

**Check**:
- Is address field filled in?
- Button should be disabled when empty
- Check console for errors

**Fix**:
- Enter an address first
- Try a well-known location like "Circle, Accra"

### Issue: Geocoding Always Fails

**Possible Causes**:
1. No internet connection
2. Geocoding API rate limit
3. Address outside Ghana

**Solutions**:
- Check internet
- Wait 5 minutes and try again
- Use "Pin Location" as fallback

### Issue: Reverse Geocoding Not Showing

**Check**:
- Does order have `customer_location`?
- Check console for "Reverse geocoding" logs
- May show coordinates as fallback

**This is OK**: Fallback to coordinates still works

### Issue: Update Location Not Saving

**Check Server Logs**:
```
PATCH /api/orders/{id}/location
```

**Check Order Status**:
- Only works for `pending` and `assigned` orders
- Won't work for `completed` or `cancelled`

### Issue: Map Not Loading

**Checks**:
- Internet connection
- expo-location installed: `npx expo install expo-location`
- react-native-maps installed
- Location permissions granted
