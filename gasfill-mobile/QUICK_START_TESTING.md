## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Demo Mode Only)

### Expected Errors in Console:
```
‚ùå Get customer orders failed: timeout of 5000ms exceeded
```
**Why:** Backend server not accessible from device  
**Impact:** None - app falls back to local storage

```
‚ùå Checkout error: Payment was not completed
```
**Why:** PaystackService trying to reach backend  
**Impact:** Checkout will fail - this is expected without backend

### Navigation Warnings:
```
Screen named 'Welcome' / 'AccountSettings' not found
```
**Why:** Some ProfileScreen navigation items point to unimplemented screens  
**Impact:** Minor - doesn't affect main flow

## üîß To Test with Real Backend

If you want to test with the actual backend API:

### 1. Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd d:\E\code\gasfil
python gasfill_app/python_server.py
```

### 2. Update API URL (Physical Device)
Edit `src/services/api.ts`:
```typescript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000'
// Replace YOUR_COMPUTER_IP with your actual IP
// Example: 'http://192.168.1.100:8000'
```

### 3. Find Your Computer's IP
```powershell
ipconfig
# Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter
```

### 4. Restart Expo
```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C in Expo terminal, then:
npx expo start --clear
```

## üìä Test Results to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- Green toasts appear
- Screens navigate smoothly
- Cart totals calculate correctly
- Data persists after app restart
- Loading spinners show/hide properly
- No app crashes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things That Won't Work (Demo Mode)
- API calls (will timeout and use demo mode)
- Payment processing (needs backend)
- Real-time order updates
- Order syncing with server

---

## üêõ If Something Breaks

### App Won't Load
```powershell
# Clear cache and restart
npx expo start --clear
```

### TypeScript Errors
```powershell
# Check for errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Can't Connect to Backend
1. Check backend is running on port 8000
2. Verify your IP address is correct
3. Check firewall settings
4. Use Android emulator (10.0.2.2) for easiest testing

## üéâ Success!

If you can complete the 5-minute test flow above, **Phase 1 is working perfectly!**

The app is designed to work offline with demo mode, so backend connection failures are handled gracefully. This is exactly what we want - a resilient app that works even when the server is unavailable.

1. **Complete Quick Test** (above)
2. **Document any bugs** you find
3. **Test on multiple devices** if available
4. **Review** `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` for comprehensive testing
5. **Consider** Phase 2 features or production deployment
