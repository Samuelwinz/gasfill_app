# Location Features Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide covers testing for two new location features:
- **Feature B**: Update delivery location for pending/assigned orders
- **Feature C**: Automatic address geocoding in checkout

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd d:\E\code\gasfil\gasfill_app
python python_server.py
```
Server should start on `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Start Mobile App
```bash
cd d:\E\code\gasfil\gasfill_app\gasfill-mobile
npx expo start
```

### 3. Device Requirements
- **GPS enabled** (for current location features)
- **Location permissions** granted to the app
- **Internet connection** (for geocoding and map tiles)

---

## Feature B: Update Delivery Location

### Test Case 1: Update Location for Pending Order

**Steps:**
1. **Place a new order** (it will be in 'pending' status)
   - Go to Products ‚Üí Add items to cart
   - Go to Cart ‚Üí Checkout
   - Fill in customer details
   - (Optionally pin location or skip it)

2. **Open Order Tracking**
   - Go to "My Orders" tab
   - Tap on the newly created order
   - You should see the delivery tracking screen

3. **Check for Update Button**
   - For pending orders, you should see either:
     - "Pin Exact Location" (if no location was pinned)
     - "Update Location" (if location was already pinned)

4. **Open Location Picker**
   - Tap the "Pin Exact Location" or "Update Location" button
   - App should request GPS permissions (if not already granted)
   - Modal should open with a map

5. **Select New Location**
   - **Option A**: Drag the red marker to your desired location
   - **Option B**: Tap anywhere on the map to move the marker
   - **Option C**: Tap the locate icon (top right) to use current GPS location
   - Coordinates should update in real-time at the bottom

6. **Confirm Location Update**
   - Review the coordinates displayed
   - Tap "Confirm Location" button
   - Should show "Updating location..." loading state

7. **Verify Success**
   - Success alert should appear
   - Tracking screen should reload
   - New location should be visible on the map
   - "Location pinned" badge should show new coordinates

8. **Verify Backend Update**
   - Check server logs for:
     ```
     PATCH /api/orders/{order_id}/location
     Successfully updated location for order {order_id}
     ```
   - Check database (optional):
     ```bash
     sqlite3 gasfill.db
     SELECT customer_location FROM orders WHERE id = '{order_id}';
     ```

### Test Case 2: Update Not Allowed for Completed Orders

**Steps:**
1. Create an order and mark it as 'completed' or 'cancelled' in the database

---

## Backend Validation

### Database Checks
After each location update or geocoded order:

```bash
# Connect to database
sqlite3 gasfill.db

# Check customer_location format
SELECT id, customer_location FROM orders WHERE id = 'YOUR_ORDER_ID';

# Expected format:
# {"lat": 5.6037, "lng": -0.1870}
```

### API Logs to Check

**For Feature B (Update Location):**
```
PATCH request to update order location: {order_id}
customer_location from request: {'lat': ..., 'lng': ...}
Successfully updated location for order {order_id}
```

**For Feature C (Geocoding):**
```
Geocoding address: Circle, Accra
Geocoded location: lat=..., lng=...
Order created with customer_location: {'lat': ..., 'lng': ...}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Geocoding Accuracy**: Depends on expo-location's geocoding API
   - May not find very specific house numbers
   - Better with landmarks and major streets

2. **Service Area**: Currently limited to Ghana
   - Coordinates validated: 4.74¬∞N to 11.17¬∞N, -3.26¬∞W to 1.20¬∞E

3. **Update Restrictions**: Can only update for pending/assigned orders
   - Cannot update for completed, cancelled, or in-transit orders

---

## Troubleshooting

### Geocoding Returns No Results
- Check internet connection
- Try more general address (e.g., "Accra" instead of specific house number)
- Use landmarks: "near Circle, Accra"
- Fall back to manual pin

### Location Update Fails
- Verify order is in pending/assigned status
- Check backend server is running
- Check API logs for errors
- Verify customer_location format is correct

### Map Not Loading
- Check internet connection
- Verify map API keys (if using Google Maps)
- Check expo-location is installed: `npx expo install expo-location`
- Check react-native-maps is installed
