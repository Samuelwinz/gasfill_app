# Commission Payment Logic Update - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Updated all commission and earnings calculations to use the new proximity-based delivery fees instead of the fixed ₵10 fee.

## Changes Made

### 1. Rider Dashboard Endpoint (`/api/rider/dashboard`)
**Location**: `python_server.py` lines ~2350-2476

#### Before:
```python
# Fixed calculation
rider_earnings_per_delivery = commission_structure.delivery_fee * commission_structure.rider_commission_rate
total_order_earnings = total_delivered_orders * rider_earnings_per_delivery
today_earnings = today_delivered * rider_earnings_per_delivery
```

#### After:
```python
# Dynamic calculation using actual delivery fees
delivered_orders = [order for order in rider_orders if order["status"] == "delivered"]
total_order_earnings = 0
for order in delivered_orders:
    order_delivery_fee = order.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)  # Use order's actual delivery fee
    rider_earning = order_delivery_fee * commission_structure.rider_commission_rate
    total_order_earnings += rider_earning

# Calculate today's earnings using actual delivery fees
today_order_earnings = 0
for order in completed_today_orders:
    order_delivery_fee = order.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)
    rider_earning = order_delivery_fee * commission_structure.rider_commission_rate
    today_order_earnings += rider_earning

# Calculate average for display
avg_delivery_fee = (sum(o.get("delivery_fee", 10.0) for o in delivered_orders) / total_delivered_orders) if total_delivered_orders > 0 else 10.0
avg_earnings_per_delivery = avg_delivery_fee * commission_structure.rider_commission_rate
```

**Impact**:
- Riders now see accurate total earnings based on actual delivery distances
- Dashboard displays average delivery fee and average earnings per delivery
- Today's earnings calculated from actual fees of today's deliveries

### 2. Admin Rider Earnings Endpoint (`/api/admin/riders/{rider_id}/earnings`)
**Location**: `python_server.py` lines ~2125-2190

#### Before:
```python
delivery_fee = rider.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)
earnings_per_delivery = delivery_fee * commission_rate
total_earnings = total_deliveries * earnings_per_delivery
today_earnings = len(today_deliveries) * earnings_per_delivery
week_earnings = len(week_deliveries) * earnings_per_delivery
month_earnings = len(month_deliveries) * earnings_per_delivery
```

#### After:
```python
# Calculate total earnings from actual delivery fees
total_earnings = 0
for order in rider_orders:
    order_delivery_fee = order.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)
    rider_earning = order_delivery_fee * commission_rate
    total_earnings += rider_earning

# Calculate today's earnings
today_earnings = 0
for order in today_deliveries:
    order_delivery_fee = order.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)
    rider_earning = order_delivery_fee * commission_rate
    today_earnings += rider_earning

# Calculate week's earnings
week_earnings = 0
for order in week_deliveries:
    order_delivery_fee = order.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)
    rider_earning = order_delivery_fee * commission_rate
    week_earnings += rider_earning

# Calculate month's earnings
month_earnings = 0
for order in month_deliveries:
    order_delivery_fee = order.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)
    rider_earning = order_delivery_fee * commission_rate
    month_earnings += rider_earning

# Calculate average delivery fee
avg_delivery_fee = (sum(o.get("delivery_fee", 10.0) for o in rider_orders) / total_deliveries) if total_deliveries > 0 else 10.0
earnings_per_delivery = avg_delivery_fee * commission_rate
```

**Response Changes**:
```python
# Old response
"delivery_fee": delivery_fee,  # Fixed ₵10
"rider_earnings": earnings_per_delivery,  # Fixed ₵8

# New response
"avg_delivery_fee": round(avg_delivery_fee, 2),  # Actual average
"delivery_fee": o.get("delivery_fee", 10.0),  # Per-order actual fee
"rider_earnings": round(o.get("delivery_fee", 10.0) * commission_rate, 2),  # Actual earnings
```

**Impact**:
- Admin sees accurate rider earnings for all time periods
- Recent deliveries show individual delivery fees and rider earnings
- Earnings breakdown reflects actual proximity-based fees

### 3. Rider Analytics Endpoint (`/api/rider/analytics`)
**Location**: `python_server.py` lines ~2490-2650

#### Before:
```python
# Assumed fixed delivery fee
delivery_fee = 20.0
rider_earnings_per_delivery = delivery_fee * commission_rate

earnings_summary = {
    "today": len(today_completed) * rider_earnings_per_delivery,
    "week": len(week_completed) * rider_earnings_per_delivery,
    "month": len(month_completed) * rider_earnings_per_delivery,
    "total": total_deliveries * rider_earnings_per_delivery
}
```

#### After:
```python
# Helper function to calculate earnings from actual fees
def calculate_earnings(order_list):
    total = 0
    for order in order_list:
        order_delivery_fee = order.get("delivery_fee", 10.0)
        total += order_delivery_fee * commission_rate
    return round(total, 2)

earnings_summary = {
    "today": calculate_earnings(today_completed),
    "week": calculate_earnings(week_completed),
    "month": calculate_earnings(month_completed),
    "total": calculate_earnings(completed_orders)
}

# Earnings trend - daily breakdown
earnings_trend[date_key]["amount"] += round(order_delivery_fee * commission_rate, 2)

# Peak hours analysis
peak_hours[hour]["earnings"] += round(order_delivery_fee * commission_rate, 2)
```

**Impact**:
- Analytics accurately reflect earnings based on delivery distances
- Daily earnings trends show actual commission amounts
- Peak hours analysis shows real earnings potential

## Commission Structure

### Current Settings:
```python
class CommissionStructure(BaseModel):
    rider_commission_rate: float = 0.80  # 80% to rider
    delivery_fee: float = 10.0  # Base fee (now for reference only)
    service_pickup_fee: float = 5.0
    service_refill_fee: float = 10.0
```

### Calculation Formula:
```
Rider Earnings = Actual Order Delivery Fee × 80%

Where Actual Order Delivery Fee:
- Base: ₵10 for ≤500m
- Additional: ₵2 per 500m increment
- Example: 5km delivery = ₵28 → Rider earns ₵22.40 (80%)
```

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Short Distance Delivery
- Distance: 800m
- Delivery Fee: ₵12.00
- Rider Earnings (80%): ₵9.60
- Admin Commission (20%): ₵2.40

### Scenario 2: Medium Distance Delivery
- Distance: 5km
- Delivery Fee: ₵28.00
- Rider Earnings (80%): ₵22.40
- Admin Commission (20%): ₵5.60

### Scenario 3: Long Distance Delivery
- Distance: 20km
- Delivery Fee: ₵90.00
- Rider Earnings (80%): ₵72.00
- Admin Commission (20%): ₵18.00

### Rider with Mixed Deliveries:
```
Delivery 1: 2km → ₵18 → Rider earns ₵14.40
Delivery 2: 5km → ₵28 → Rider earns ₵22.40
Delivery 3: 10km → ₵48 → Rider earns ₵38.40
Total Earnings: ₵75.20
Average per delivery: ₵25.07
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Orders without `delivery_fee` field default to ₵10.00
- Existing orders migrated with correct proximity-based fees
- No breaking changes to API response structure
- Mobile app receives same data structure with accurate values

## Database Schema

The `delivery_fee` column was added to the orders table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN delivery_fee REAL DEFAULT 10.0
```

All historical orders have been migrated with correct fees based on their delivery locations.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Dashboard Verification**:
   - Check rider dashboard shows varying delivery fees
   - Verify average earnings reflect actual fees
   - Confirm today's earnings match actual deliveries

2. **Admin View**:
   - View rider earnings in admin panel
   - Check weekly/monthly breakdowns
   - Verify recent deliveries show individual fees

3. **Analytics**:
   - Check earnings trends for accuracy
   - Verify peak hours show correct earnings
   - Ensure daily breakdowns sum correctly

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with all ₵10 deliveries (short distance)
   - Test with mixed distance deliveries
   - Test with very long distance deliveries (₵100+)

## Impact Summary
